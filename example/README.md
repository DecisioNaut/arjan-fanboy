# Example

Let's have a look what the *arjan-fanboy* skill can do with some example code snippets!

For that purpose, we'll use code from Arjan's [bettercode](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/betterpython) repository, which contains a lot of examples of how to apply the principles and patterns that Arjan advocates for.

More precisely, we'll take the [dependency-inversion-before.py](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/betterpython/blob/main/2%20-%20dependency%20inversion/dependency-inversion-before.py) as [before.py](./before.py) as our starting point.

We ask the Agent:

> _How would Arjan refactor this code?_
>
> _Please save it as after-using-arjan-fanboy.py."_

Then, we'll save [dependency-inversion-after.py](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/betterpython/blob/main/2%20-%20dependency%20inversion/dependency-inversion-after.py) as [after.py](./after.py) and ask the Agent: 

> _Please compare after.py and after-using-arjan-fanboy.py from Arjan's perspective?_
>
> _Please save the file to "ARJAN-FANBOYS-PERSPECTIVE.md"._

**Our verdict**: 

Keeping in mind that the code in `after.py` is more than 5 years old, it is quite interesting how well it holds up to Arjan's current principles and style.

However, the **arjan-fanboy** is maybe a bit too "catholic" in its application of Arjan's principles, which leads to a more "Arjan-idealized" version of the code. 

P.S.: A nice thing was that the Agent asked us, if we want a small test or show a variant with a mock Switchable for easier testing.
